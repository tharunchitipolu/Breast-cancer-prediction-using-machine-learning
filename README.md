# Breast-cancer-prediction-using-machine-learning



Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide,
representing the majority of new cancer cases and cancer-related deaths according to global statistics

The dataset I have used in this repo is publicly available and was created by Dr. William H. Wolberg,
physician at the University Of Wisconsin Hospital at Madison, Wisconsin, USA.

Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

    radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
    texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
    perimeter
    area
    smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
    compactness (perimeter² / area — 1.0)
    concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
    concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
    symmetry
    fractal dimension 
    
Through this features one can predict the tumor is either Malignant(cancer causing) or Benign(normal tumor) 
using machine learning

The algorithm that i have used is Support Vector Machines which have  97.2% accuracy in prediction.
